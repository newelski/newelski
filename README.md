# Hey there, I'm Matt! 👋

## Front-End Developer passionate about accessible User Experiences, scalable User Interfaces, and creative solutions to complex problems.

I bring digital experiences from thought to production while empowering those around me. The core values in everything I do are **curiosity**, **bravery**, and **kindness**.

🚀 **Latest Projects:** Recently launched a URL shortener at [nwl.ski](https://nwl.ski) after finding a perfect domain name for it. Outside of web development I am working a cross-platform app to help optimize Google Drive storage usage by compressing video and image files.
